            <p> 
                A problem solver and a extremly curious person, I have dabbled and suceeded in having sound but proficient knowledge about
                data structure and algorithms and the MERN stack. I have also dabbled into Competitve Programming also managing 
                to excel it. My current codeforces rating is 1127. I have also managed to secure 2nd
                place in College's Biggest Annual Hackathon , Hatch From Scratch, out of the participating 50+ teams.
                I am always up for challenges and currently exploring what Computer Science has to offer

                As an active member of college's IEEE and GDSC student chapters, I have conducted C++ and DSA Workshop for over 300
                students proving my ability to lead and guide people in areas that I am proficient at. 
                These are some of the languages that are in my tech stack:
